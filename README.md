# GL_collision

Small collision simulation project created in OpenGL. An equilateral triangle is able to move and rotate in a window, and can collide with the window's boundaries. Collision is not physically realistic (will be implemented in the future), i.e. momentum and energy are not conserved. Upon collision the triangle's translational as well as rotational speed are simply reversed. Users can also adjust size and rotational speed of the triangle. 
The libraries GLFW and GLEW are used and are not included in the project, they can be downloaded from their respective websites and must be added in the directory
